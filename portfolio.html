                <h2 class="project-name" The Zoo Page> The Zoo Page </h2>
                <p> In this zoo problem project, I build a page that made it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors.</p>
                <p> Created a description for each animal,a link for each animal so the client can quickly find out more information on each animal.</p>

                    <h2 class="project-name" My Very organized Grocery List> My Very organized Grocery List</h2>
                    <p> Made an organized grocery list, instead of it being on paper needed to move it online. With this project I was able to get more practice on front end develpoment and more experience with html and css.
                        My goal was to create an HTML file that has food photos, different categories of grocery items and list the different items.
