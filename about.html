    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>Every Sunday Evening, I always enjoy playing basketball at my local park with my cousins. 
        Ive always loved palying basketball from playing in my highschool's team, To playing it just for fun on my free times now. It is a great time to have fun and keep your mind and body foucused. Basketball challenes me to compete and have fun its a great time to get your mind of the hustle and busyness of the day.love with basketball is that it's a sport of teamwork. This is because the success of the team depends on the effort of each and every member. In other terms is that the team must rely on each other to be able to succeed. The teamwork ensures that the best team wins.

    <p> I love how playing basketball, You meet tons of people and you are able to play with your friends for hours without getting one thought of boredom. Another thing I love about basketball is that people have many different styles of play. There are styles such as a passer, playmaker, shooter, defensive player, and dunker or highflyer.

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
        Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. playing video games regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity. I enjoy playing video games also because it stimulates creativity, and my probelm solving skills. 

    </p>
    <p>
        For me I believe gaming helped me develop and improve my problem solving skills, since a very young age too. I am a great problem solver because I can compartmentalize all aspects of a problem before studying it. and enjoy trying to figure out how certain things can be solved. I feel like playing Video games can help bring out these types of mental solving skills, while being able to have fun doing it.
        Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. I enjoy playing for a couple hours when I have some free time or on my off days. I enjoy playing Open-world, mission-based, and multi-level games which can be designed like complex puzzles that take several hours to solve. its a great way to solve puzzles and and multitask. I have a keen eye for detail and have always beleived that an Effective problem solver, often has personalities that make them thrive when there's a deadline approaching or they're facing a complex workplace challenge.
